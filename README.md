##Background

Cyclistic runs a bike-share initiative boasting over 5,800 bikes and 600 docking stations. What makes Cyclistic stand out is its diverse range of options, including reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes. This variety makes bike-sharing accessible to individuals with disabilities and those who can't ride a standard two-wheeled bike. While most riders prefer traditional bikes, approximately 8% opt for assistive options. Cyclistic users generally enjoy recreational rides, but around 30% rely on the bikes for their daily commute to work.
