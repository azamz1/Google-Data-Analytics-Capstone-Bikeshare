Hello!

This is my capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. It is the final assignment of the last course, serving as a comprehensive summary of everything leanred during this program through a case study analysis. The case study revolves around addressing a business problem using the 6 Phase Analysis methodology (Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, Act).

In this project, I will show my analysis of Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company. This study draws on historical data from the actual Chicago bike-share company, Divvy.
